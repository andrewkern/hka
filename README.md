# HKA
This is a barebones, multilocus HKA test that I originally implemented for use on the ENCODE pilot project. It is very much in the spirit of Jody Hey's HKA multilocus test, however this version is less flexible (no inheritence scalars, no coalescent sims) but considerably faster. 

#install
the only prereq for this code is the GNU scientific library. One you have GSL installed you should be able to simple type `make` to build the code
